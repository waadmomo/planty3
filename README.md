I used Python to:
  •	Handle server-side logic using Flask.
  •	Manage routing between web pages and process HTTP requests.
  •	Store plant information and set reminders.
With guidance from my mentor I used HTML and CSS to:
  •	Design and structure web pages (with guidance from my mentor).
  •	Create an intuitive user interface for easy navigation.
Additionally, I combined Python and HTML to develop my favorite app features—the search bar and filter buttons—to enhance the user experience and modernize the user interface
